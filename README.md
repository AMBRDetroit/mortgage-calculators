# Mortgage Calculators

This JS Library contains functions commonly used with mortgage calculations. 

## Background
While trying to build a set of mortgage calculators for a client, we were hoping to find a Javascript library that contained the functions.
After hours of research, we were unable to find any Javascript library. However, we found a bunch of spreadsheets and after thorough investigation, developed our own functions.

## Modules
This library contains 7 different modules used for different 
1. Monthly Mortgage Payment
2. Monthly Mortgage Payment With Extra Monthly Payments
3. 15 Year VS 30 Year Mortgage
4. How Much Can I Borrow ?
5. Fixed Rate VS ARM
6. Refinance Mortgage
7. Should I Buy or Rent a home?

## Getting Started
To get started you can download the minified code src/mortgage-calculators.js or clone the entire repo and import it into your next project.
